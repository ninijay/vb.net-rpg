# Description
A 2D- RPG Game with including the following functionalities:
* Add your own Character as Sprites (If you can draw/ find some)
* Design your own maps (in textfiles)
* Talking with NPC's
* Walking around on your designed maps

# How To Design Maps
To Design your maps, you have to make a map- file containing numbers and meta-data (There's an example in it).
You'll need the following:
* Sprites for Map- Textures (Mountain, Grass and dark Grass are already included)
* mapfile

It's simple, you have the sprites with the name "somenumber.jpg" (eg: 1.jpg, 2.jpg) and you can put the numbers in the mapfile according to how it should look like, eg:

    1,1,1,1
    2,2,1,2
    3,1,1,2

Will have the textures of 1.jpg, 2.jpg and 3.jpg aligned like you put them in the file :)
